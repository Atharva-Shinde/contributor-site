## General Information

### What is the Kubernetes Contributor Celebration?

The Kubernetes Contributor Celebration is an attempt to reclaim that and
celebrate our accomplishments. It's a time for us to relax, chat and do something
fun with your fellow contributors!

### When is it?

It will be from the afternoon (Pacific Time) December 10th through the weekend,
ending on December 13th.

### How do I register?

Please fill out the [registration form].

[registration form]: https://forms.gle/51tqQgxuHxLaeU1P8

### Are friends and family allowed?

Allowed and encouraged! Please have them register as a friend or family member
and use the email you registered with as the reference. They must agree to abide
by the Code of Conduct while attending.


### Where is the celebration being held?

The celebration will be hosted on [Discord], a hosted online communication
platform similar to Slack, but with a focus on voice and video in addition to
text base chat. It’s been built to support the hosting of a
[safe, positive and inclusive space]. 


### When will I get my invite?

Discord server invites will be sent out closer to the event.


### What sort of activities are planned?

There will be trivia and other games available. For more information see the
[activities] page.

[activities]: /events/2020/kcc/activities/


## Discord Information

### How do I join?

Please see the [How to join] page.

[How to join]: /events/2020/kcc/how-to-join/

### Why do I need to verify myself once I connect (complete captcha)?

Spam bots and raids are more common with Discord than other platforms such as
slack. Completing the external Captcha helps us keep Discord a safe place to
have fun <3


### Why do I need to agree to abide by the Code of Conduct?

Much like other communication platforms used by Kubernetes (and other CNCF
projects) we want this to be an inclusive and inviting place for everyone. We
understand that certain things like profane language are used by many while
gaming, please still try to be inclusive and not offensive. 

Remember: Don’t be a jerk. :) 


### Why can I only see the instructions-to-connect and info channels?

You’ve completed the captcha, but haven’t agreed to the code of conduct, head
over to the `#code-of-conduct` channel and accept it, and you’ll be able to see
everything. If you need assistance, join the `#help` channel.


### What is this YAGPDB.xyz and why is it messaging me?

<img align="left" src="/events/past-events/2020/kcc2020/yagpdb.png" width="40" height="40">

[YAGPDB] (Yet Another General Purpose Discord Bot) is a verified discord bot
that we use to manage a variety of services within discord, from verification
and moderation to role selection and automation.


### How do I display my pronouns in Discord?

In Discord, you can set a nickname per-”server”. We recommend putting your
pronouns in your nickname so they are visible at all times in Discord and with
overlays. A few examples of what this would look like:
- `Arty (they/them)`
- `Bob (he/him)`
- `Jamie (she/her)`

1 ) To do so, click the server dropdown (Top Left)

<img align="center" src="/events/past-events/2020/kcc2020/server.png" width="40%">
<br>
<br>
2 ) Select “Change Nickname”
<br>
<br>
<img align="center" src="/events/past-events/2020/kcc2020/nickname.png" width="40%">
<br>
<br>
3 ) Then follow the template of “nickname (pro/noun)” like so:
<br>
<br>
<img align="center" src="/events/past-events/2020/kcc2020/name.png" width="40%">


### What are the `#<channel>-info` channels for?

For games that are popular enough to have their own category, the info channel
in them will describe the game, links to where it can be downloaded, and will
provide guidance on reporting people for that game/platform.

### What are the `#<channel>-links` channels for?

Often when you’re having a conversation in one of the voice channels you’ll want
to share a link with the other people on voice. You can’t do this directly in
the voice channels, and it can clutter up the main text-chat channels, so the
`#<channel>-links` channels are a scratch-pad for links or other things that
are only relevant to the conversation carrying on in voice chat.

### How do I know if someone is a Moderator, Staff Member or an Admin?

The member list on the right hand side of Discord will display the active members
and which group they are. Mods, Staff Members, and Admins can also be recognized
by the color of their username.

<ul> 
  <li style="color:#326CE5">Members are blue</li>
  <li style="color:#E67E23">Staff members are orange</li>
  <li style="color:#F1C40E">Moderators are yellow</li>
  <li style="color:#E91E63">Admins are red</li>
</ul>



### Someone is spamming/harassing me, what should I do?

If they’re within discord, use the command:
```
/report <@username> <reason>
```
You can also ask for assistance in `#help`. A member of the mod team
will reach out.

If it's within a game and the person is not a part of this event, please use the
in game method of reporting / blocking the person.


### Discord is running slowly or stuttering, what should I do?

On Mac and occasionally on other platforms, Discord can stutter and consume a
significant amount of CPU resources. The current workaround is to disable
_Hardware Acceleration_. You can disable it in your _User Settings_ by clicking
on the cog next to your username and navigating to the setting here:


**User Settings -> Appearance -> Advanced -> Hardware Acceleration**


### Help! I have a question?

You can ask in the `#help` channel and a staff member will try and help.
